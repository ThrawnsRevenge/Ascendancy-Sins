StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_EXPLAINHOMEPLANET0"
	Value "The nexus of your empire's influence in the galaxy is your Capital Planet. The further away your empire's planets are from your Capital Planet, the lower their base allegiance will be."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_EXPLAINHOMEPLANET1"
	Value "Planets with partial allegiance suffer reduced tax and resource income. Go ahead and bring up the InfoCards for your other planets to see their allegiance."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_EXPLAINHOMEPLANET2"
	Value "To select a planet as your Capital, select Designate Capital Planet from the planet upgrade menu. If you have an existing capital already, it will be moved to the designated planet when the upgrade is complete."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT0"
	Value "As your empire expands to more and more planets, your income growth will begin to lessen due to lost allegiance. One way of offsetting this is by building Trade Ports."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT1"
	Value "Trade Ports automatically produce autonomous trade ships that transport goods between friendly planets with Trade Ports. Each Trade Port produces credits over time, at a rate that scales with the number of trade ships it has launched."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT2"
	Value "Each Trade Port also earns extra income proportional to the longest chain of planets with trade ports in your trade network. You can see the extents of this chain by mousing over your credit summary at the top of the HUD."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDTRADEPORTS"
	Value "Go ahead and build a Trade Port at both your terran and desert planets. They are built from the Logistics Structure menu. For the rest of the tutorial the restrictions on how many structures you can build will be relaxed."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY0"
	Value "Excellent. If your empire requires more metal or crystal than your planets' extractors can provide, one way of acquiring more is to build Refineries."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY1"
	Value "Like Trade Ports, Refineries automatically produce autonomous cargo ships that scales their resource income. These ships seek out resource extractors belonging to your empire at adjacent gravity wells."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDREFINERY"
	Value "Because each refinery draws from extractors in nearby gravity wells and each extractor can only support a few refineries, building too many refineries will not increase your resource income efficiently. Go ahead and build one at your desert planet."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE0"
	Value "Good. The last core element of logistics is culture. It is produced from Broadcast Center logistic structures, so build one at your terran planet now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE1"
	Value "Culture spreads along the Phase Lanes between planets, and is represented by a growing line in that empire's color. The further abroad culture from a given planet spreads, the slower its spread rate becomes."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE2"
	Value "As culture spreads, it causes shifts in allegiance. Friendly culture will cause allegiance to increase slowly to a slightly higher maximum, whereas hostile culture causes allegiance to slowly drop to zero."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE3"
	Value "If allegiance reaches zero at a planet, the planet's current government is overthrown, causing the planet to become neutral."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE4"
	Value "Strong cultural influence can also prevent an attacking empire from colonizing planets that have had their infrastructure destroyed by bombardment."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE5"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_INTRO"
	Value "Your fleets won't always be within range to help defend your planets as you move out into the galaxy. To protect your assets, it's important to fortify them."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_TURRETS"
	Value "One way to protect your orbital structures is by building defense turrets. These stationary cannons can cover large areas of the gravity well from invaders. As you research new technology in the Defense tech tree, they'll grow in power."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONBUILD"
	Value "Build a defense turret now. Select the planet or a constructor, then click the Tactical Structures button and finally on Gauss Defense Platform."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONPLACEMENT"
	Value "The ring that appears around the cannon indicates the range of its weapons. Go ahead and place it within range of some of your other structures."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONINFO"
	Value "Good. Your cannon will automatically fire on enemies within range. Overlapping your cannons will yield even better results."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONMOREINFO"
	Value "Turrets can spin 360 degrees around, but cannot change position in space. This makes them best for covering general areas of your gravity wells from enemies where you've concentrated your other structures."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONHANGERTRANS"
	Value "By researching additional subjects in the Defense technology tree, you can access additional methods of fortifying your planets."
StringInfo

	Value "Go ahead and research Hangar Defense from the Defense tree now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERINTRO"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERINFO"
	Value "As with turrets, Hangar Defense can be upgraded through research to offer even greater protection."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERBULID"
	Value "Go ahead and place a Hangar Defense now. Since the Hangar Defense itself is defenseless, it's best to place it within the protection of a turret."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRINTRO"
	Value "While fending off invaders, your structures and ships will take hull damage. Over time, this damage will be repaired by your crews, but a faster way to get the job done is with a Repair Platform."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRRESEARCH"
	Value "Repair Platform must also be researched before they can be constructed. Go ahead and do this now via the Military tech tree."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRINFO"
	Value "Repair Platform can repair an unlimited number of damaged structures or ships within their range - until they exhaust their fighter supply supply."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRPLACEMENT"
	Value "Build a Repair Platform within range of your other structures now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEINTRO"
	Value "Despite your best efforts, the enemy will still likely penetrate your defenses and inflict some damage on you. Mine fields are an excellent way of dishing out payback to the enemy."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINERESEARCH"
	Value "Research Proximity Mines now from the Defense tech tree."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEBUILD"
	Value "Each race has its own way of deploying space mines. The TEC construct theirs in fields which automatically detonate when an enemy vessel comes in proximity."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEPLACEMENT"
	Value "Mines can be placed anywhere within your gravity well for a small fee. To be most effective, they should be placed near to structures since enemy vessels will move to attack them. Build Mines near your other structures now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINTRO"
	Value "Ultimately, the best way to protect your planets is with a starbase. Starbases are extremely powerful defensive structures that can assault multiple enemies simultaneously."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINFO"
	Value "Starbases are deployed through heavy constructor cruisers. Most starbases cannot move once deployed, so it's important to build the base exactly where you want it."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASERESEARCH"
	Value "Go ahead and research the Raloz Prototype from the Defense tech tree."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEBUILD"
	Value "As with mine fields, your starbase can be deployed anywhere within the gravity well, but it's best kept near important structures. Go ahead and deploy a starbase now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEUPGRADES"
	Value "Starbases can be upgraded for an additional cost to add new abilities, weapons or defenses. New abilities must first be researched via the Defense tech tree, while additional offensive systems are immediately available."
StringInfo

	Value "Racial Inclination indicates the tension and dislike the TEC, Advent and Vasari feel for one another. Factions of the same race think more highly of one another than they do of outsiders. Racial Inclination can be mitigated through diplomatic research."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_REBELLION"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_DIPLOMATIC_ACTIONS"
	Value "Diplomatic Actions are the side-effects of the treaties and pacts you make with other factions. Joining forces with an empire who is despised by others will generally not make you many friends."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_TRANSITION"
	Value "Relations can also be improved by envoy cruisers, trade, completing missions, research and gifting resources to other empires. Let's look at some of these in more detail."
