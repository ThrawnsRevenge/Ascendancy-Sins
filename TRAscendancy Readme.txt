Delete all old versions before installing.

Extract the zip file to your mods folder, found here:

...Documents\My Games\Ironclad Games\Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion\Mods-Rebellion v1.85 
(Default- after v1.85 all mod folders became compatible, yours may be up to 1.90, as long as it's 1.85 or above, it will work)

To run the mod, either enable it ingame from the mods menu, or edit EnabledMods with notepad to contain the following four lines:
TXT
Version 0
enabledModNameCount 1
enabledModName "Ascendancy116"

Then you can run Sins normally, and Ascendancy will load.

If the base game runs instead of the mod after doing this, you likely have an extra folder in there somewhere. Sometimes this can happen if you used the wrong extraction option. Make sure your directory goes:
Mods-Rebellion v1.85\Ascendancy116\(GameInfo, Textures, etc)

and not:
Mods-Rebellion v1.85 \Ascendancy116\Ascendancy116\(GameInfo, Textures, etc)
